Scott is a Seattle Product Management hero! He was my Director of Marketing Systems and Tools at the Product Management Consortium (now the Product Management Community). He helped that organization mature its business from vision to execution. Scott is a strong leader. He takes direction with grace and acuity, and he pushes back with respect and passion. Managing Scott made me a better leader. Scott is a great communicator and mentor that readily gives back to the community. I trust him to take hard stands and accomplish great things. I would be lucky to work with Scott again.
