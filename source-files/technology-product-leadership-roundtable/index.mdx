# Technology Product Leadership Roundtable

Every 6 weeks (?) in the Seattle area we get together for a few hours with a small invited group of Director+ leaders in Software Engineering & Product Management roles building products in the cloud to discuss topics of interest.

## The Topics

We discuss topics related to leading teams building products in the cloud such as:

- Product/Company Strategy
- New technologies and interesting applications of it
- People Management & Talent Development
- Teams, Roles & Organizational Design & Transformation
- Product Planning Techniques
- Agile & Lean Software Development Best Practices
- Engineering/Product Operations from Support to DevOps
- Effective Communications from facilitating meetings, to presentations to executives or investors
- Market/Industry Trends
- Security & Compliance Best Practices

## The Format

Members submit topics that they are interested in hearing about or presenting on. The presenter introduces the topic for 30 minutes and then we transition to a roundtable discussion or exercise for 30 minutes on the topic. The roundtable or exercise will have a moderator. For roundtable discussions the moderator helps start the discussion with questions, and then as the discussion develops helps the group stay on topic and make sure everyone gets a chance to be heard. For exercises, the moderator will be responsible for facilitating the exercise. We end each meeting with a 5 minute retrospective.
